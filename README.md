## 🔧 WHAT YOU’LL BUILD

A home security system that:
- Detects motion using a PIR sensor
- Sends **instant SMS alerts** using SIM800L GSM module
- Can be **armed/disarmed** using a pushbutton
- Remembers its armed state (uses EEPROM)
- Works offline — even when Wi-Fi or power goes out

---

## 🧰 WHAT YOU NEED

- ✅ Arduino Uno or Nano
- ✅ SIM800L GSM module
- ✅ PIR motion sensor
- ✅ Pushbutton + 10kΩ resistor
- ✅ SIM card (SMS-enabled)
- ✅ Jumper wires + breadboard
- ✅ Power supply (3.7–4.2V for SIM800L)

---

## 📸 HOW IT WORKS

1. **Motion detected** by PIR sensor  
2. Arduino triggers **SMS alert** via SIM800L  
3. You receive a message like:  
   _“Alert! Motion detected at home!”_  
4. Optional: Add buzzer, LED, or relay for sirens/lights
