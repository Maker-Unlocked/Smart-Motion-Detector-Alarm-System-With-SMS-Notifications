📸 How It Works

    Motion is detected by the PIR sensor.

    Arduino sends an SMS alert via SIM800L.

    You receive the message on your phone in seconds.

    A physical button toggles system arming.

No internet. No apps. Just reliable SMS security.
🧠 Why This Project?

This is perfect if you're:

    A beginner learning Arduino + GSM modules

    Building offline IoT projects

    Looking for a low-power remote alert system

🛠️ Code

The full Arduino code is available in the /code directory. Just open it in the Arduino IDE, install the SoftwareSerial library (built-in), and you're ready.

🔒 Disclaimers

    SMS charges may apply (check with your carrier).

    Ensure your SIM800L module is powered with stable voltage (3.7V–4.2V max).

    This is a hobby project — do not rely on it for critical applications.
